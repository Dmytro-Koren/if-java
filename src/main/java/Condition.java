       /* Task1:

        Description: This task takes an integer n as input and performs a specific calculation based on the value of n.
        Logic:
        If n is negative, it returns the absolute value of n.
        If n is positive, it returns the square of n.
        If n is zero, it returns 0.
        Example:
        Input: 2
        Output: 4


        Task2:

        Description: This task takes an integer n as input and performs a specific manipulation on its digits under certain conditions.
        Logic:
        If n is between 100 and 999 (inclusive), it rearranges the digits of n in descending order.
        If n is not within this range, it returns n unchanged.
        Example:
        Input: 401
        Output: 410 */
